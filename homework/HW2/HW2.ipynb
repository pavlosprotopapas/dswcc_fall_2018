    "    * **IMPORTANT**: You may use a different GPU instance, but you **MUST** explicitely state which instance you are using.  If you don't tell us the exact instance you are using, we may not be able to reproduce your results and you will receive no credit on this problem.\n",
    "  - When you get to `Step 6: Configure Security Group`, you have some decisions to make.\n",
    "    * Option 1: Keep the default security group.  You will be able to launch the instance, `ssh` to it, and run jobs on it, but you won't be able to open a `Juptyer` notebook from the instance.\n",
    "    * Option 2: Add a new security group like we did in Lab 3.  Be sure to follow the Lab3 instructions carefully!\n",
    "  - Choose the correct authentication key and launch the instance!\n",
